# social-network-api

## Description
With this social media api you are able to create a user and create thoughts. As a user, you can add friends and create reactions to thoughts. Others can react to your thoughts too. This application currently runs only through back end calls. To start the server, use "node server.js".

## Usage

Free to use. Make sure to seed data in the database through api calls. I used Insomnia.

## Installation
Run npm i to install any dependencies.

## Future Development

Delete reactions from thoughts. Associate thoughts with corresponding users.
